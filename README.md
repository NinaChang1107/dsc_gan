# Deep Subspace Clustering + GAN

Tensorflow implementation of our NIPS'17 paper:

Pan Ji*, Tong Zhang*, Hongdong Li, Mathieu Salzmann, Ian Reid. Deep Subspace Clustering Networks. in NIPS'17.

Due to several requests, an unpolished version of our codes (for EYaleB) is released here (Caution!! I'm not even sure that I uploaded the latest version...). A better commented/polished version will come soon.
